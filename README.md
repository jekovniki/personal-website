# My personal website

This is the codebase for my personal website. It uses React and there is no backend (only static frontend).

# Why React and not plain HTML, CSS and JS?

To be honest - I just wanted to do it with React. Plain HTML, CSS and JS would've been quicker. But at the time at making it I hadn't touched react in a couple of months and I just wanted to do it with it.
